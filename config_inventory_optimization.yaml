# CARRYING COST COMPONENTS

  storage_percent: 0.10               # Warehousing, rent, utilities, handling
  service_percent: 0.02               # Insurance, taxes
  risk_percent: 0.05                  # Obsolescence, shrinkage, damage, spoilage

  # Maximum utilization target
  # Keep 15% free for aisles, operations, emergencies

  # Space requirements per unit (square feet)
  # Adjust based on your actual product dimensions

    LARGE: 3.0                        # Large/bulky items: 3 sq ft

  # ABC Classification Space Allocation
  # How to allocate limited warehouse space
  # A items (high turnover): Get 80% of space
  # B items (medium turnover): Get 15% of space

    A: 0.80

# ============================================================
# SERVICE LEVEL & LEAD TIME
# ============================================================
service_level:

  # Extra safety buffer (in days)
  # Adds extra safety stock beyond statistical calculation

  # Maximum time between orders
  # Don't order more than X months of supply at once
  max_order_cycle_days: 90            # Review orders at least quarterly (3 months)

# ============================================================
# OPTIMIZATION CONSTRAINTS
# ============================================================
constraints:
  # Maximum order quantity (months of supply)
  # Prevents ordering a full year's supply at once
  max_order_quantity_months: 6        # Don't order more than 6 months supply

  # Minimum order value (dollars)
  # Don't place orders below this value
  min_order_value: 100.0              # Minimum $100 per order

  # Minimum order quantity (units)
  # Minimum units to order

  # Rounding precision
  # Round order quantities to nearest unit

# ============================================================
# HOW TO CUSTOMIZE THIS FILE
# ============================================================
#
# 1. CARRYING COST:
#    - Adjust cost_of_capital_percent based on your interest rates
#    - Adjust storage_percent based on your warehousing costs
#    - Adjust risk_percent based on spoilage/obsolescence rates
#
# 2. TRANSPORTATION:
#    - Update ftl_minimum_units based on your truck capacity
#    - Update ftl_fixed_cost based on your carrier rates
#    - Adjust volume_discount_tiers based on supplier discounts
#
# 3. WAREHOUSE:
#    - Set total_capacity_sqft to your actual warehouse size
#    - Adjust max_utilization_pct (typically 80-90%)
#    - Update space_per_unit_sqft based on product dimensions
#    - Adjust abc_space_allocation based on your product mix
#
# 4. SERVICE LEVEL:
#    - target_fill_rate: 0.95 (95%), 0.99 (99%) for critical items
#    - lead_time_buffer_days: 7-14 days for longer/sauffer lead times
#
# 5. CONSTRAINTS:
#    - max_order_quantity_months: Lower for perishables, higher for stable items
#    - min_order_value: Set based on your order processing costs
